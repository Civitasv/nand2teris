# Week 1

Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing AND and NOT operations.

$x OR y = NOT(NOT(x) and NOT(y))$

NAND Function:

$x NAND y = not(x AND y)$

Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing NAND operations.

1. Not(x) = (x NAND x)
2. (x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)
